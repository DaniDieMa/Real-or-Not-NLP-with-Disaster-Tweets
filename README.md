# Real-or-Not-NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets

This Repository contains the data that has been used to solve the proposed problem at the competion https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview.

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running. 

When submited to the Kaggle competion, the results obtained in this notebook scored a 0.80140, on top 38% percentile.
